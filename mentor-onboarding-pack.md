# Mentoring Onboarding Packet

Welcome to MYOB Protege Mentoring!

We're excited to have you as a mentor. This packet contains information that technical mentor's have found helpful.

We recommend looking through it often - think of this packet as your Hitchhiker's Guide while you are a protege mentor at MYOB! 

This packet is available at https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/Accelerate_Mentor_Material. Feel free to file a pull request to improve any aspect of it, no matter how tiny.
